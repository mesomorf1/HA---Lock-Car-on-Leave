Created this for my Kia EV9 that donÂ´t support walk-away locking.

Will work for all other cars that support:
* Intergration in Home Assistant
* Remote locking
* Android Auto / Car Play

I have put brackets [] where you need to enter your own details like:

[CAR MAC ADDRESS]


[LOCK_DEVICE_ID]


[CAR_DOOR_LOCK_ENTITY]
